I must admit I didn't think much of Andy the first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. 

/

That was my first impression of the man. The man in the shape of things to come. Andy Dufresne, two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover. 

/

In 1947, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank prison. All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock hammer, damn near worn down to the nub.

On a restless night in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, a group of friends gathers in a dimly lit basement. 

/

The air is thick with anticipation as they prepare for another session of Dungeons & Dragons. Little do they know that their ordinary lives are about to take a supernatural turn. 

/

A mysterious girl with a shaved head appears, her name Eleven tattooed on her wrist. As the friends embark on a quest for adventure, they uncover a parallel dimension known as the Upside Down. 

/

The line between reality and the unknown blurs, setting the stage for a chilling and otherworldly adventure.

/

In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. 

/

On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. 

/

In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.

/

Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter for hire, rides into the war-torn land of Velen. His silver sword hangs at his side, a medallion bouncing off his chest with each stride of his horse. 

/

The air is thick with the stench of decay and the sounds of distant battles. As he navigates the muddy paths, a notice board catches his eye, covered in contracts and pleas for help. 

/

The war has brought chaos, and the monsters lurking in the shadows are not the only threats Geralt must face.

/

As colossal Titans breach the towering Walls that once protected humanity, chaos ensues. Eren Yeager, fueled by a desire for vengeance, joins the military along with his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman and their friend Armin Arlert. 

/

The Survey Corps faces the relentless onslaught of Titans as the mysteries behind their existence and the truth about the world unfold. 

/

Eren's journey becomes a relentless pursuit of freedom and survival against towering giants and the secrets hidden within the walls.
